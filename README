InstCov README
-------------------------------

InstCov is a Clang-based instrumentation tool for branch coverage and
MCDC coverage recording.

To use the tool, you need to follow these steps:

1. Convert your original source code into an intermediate form using
instcov. The code will be injected with profiling code (**Note the
terminating double dashes**):

  <path-to-instcov>/instcov <your-source-file> [other compilation
  args] --

2. Build the instrumented code by explicitly including "instcov_rt.h"
during the compiling process, and explicitly linking with
"libinstcov_rt.a".

Then all should be fine.

Alternatively, you can use the wrapper scripts shipped with this
package. You need to customize the directories in the scripts before
using them. The descriptions for the scripts are as follows:

instcov.sh: it's just a redirection of instcov, if you don't want to
modify your PATH environment

ccwraper.sh: a wrapper for compiling the transformed code. It will
automatically add "-include" and "-l" options to the compiler and
linker.
